Files in this directory are test programs to render svg files using the GD
graphics library (https://libgd.github.io/) and libmsvg of course.

They are not part of libmsvg really, but you can use it as an example of how 
render svg files using libmsvg and a specific graphics library.

I have little knowledge of the GD library, in fact this is my first time using
it to have another test case for libmsvg besides MGRX. At this moment, circles
and ellipses are converted to path elementes, because GD does not provide primitives
to draw them with a thickness other than 1, nor rotated. It is also necessary to
see how to render PATH elements when their subPATHs intersect.

Only checked on Linux, there is a simple makefile, run it by:

    make

Test programs:

rsvg -> read ../svgpics/test.svg and renders it to test.png
gsvg -> generates a MsvgElemnt tree programmatically and renders it to test2.png
svg2png -> run it with: svg2png [-f|p|s] [-l|c|r] [-gd width height] file.svg file.png
           file.svg will be rendered to file.png
           options:
                -f|p|s => FIT, PAR(default) or SCOORD
                -l|c|r => LEFT(default), CENTER or RIGHT
                -gd width height => use the given dimensions for the output file,
                                    by default it uses the svg file dimensions
           example: ./svg2png ../svgpics/gtiger.svg gtiger.png
