libmsvg test programs:

tread [-r] [-id=id] file.svg -> read the svg file, print the raw tree and counts
                         and write "msvgt1.svg",
                         if "-r" show debug info when reading the svg file,
                         if a "-id=id" is provided find the element in the raw
                         tree, convert to cooked and find again

tdel -> build a raw tree, delete, prune and insert elements and attributes

tcook [-utc] [-ng] file.svg -> read the svg file, convert to cooked and serialize,
                         if "-utc" is provided MsvgTransformCookedElement
                         is called for each serialized element
                         if "-ng" is provided MsvgNormalizeRawGradients
                         is called before converting to cooked tree

trbuild -> build a raw tree, write "msvgt2a.svg", duplicate the tree and
           write "msvgt2b.svg"

tcbuild -> build a cooked tree, convert to raw tree, print and write "msvgt3.svg"
