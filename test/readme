libmsvg test programs:

tread [-r] [-id=id] file.svg -> read the svg file, print the raw tree and counts
                         and write "msvgt1.svg",
                         if "-r" show debug info when reading the svg file,
                         if a "-id=id" is provided find the element in the raw
                           tree, convert to cooked and find again

tdel -> build a raw tree, delete, prune and insert elements and attributes

tcook [-w] [-utc] [-ng] file.svg -> read the svg file, convert to cooked and serialize,
                         if "-w" is provided call MsvgCooked2RawTree and write 
                           "msvgt4.svg"
                         if "-utc" is provided MsvgTransformCookedElement
                           is called for each serialized element
                         if "-ng" is provided MsvgNormalizeRawGradients
                           is called before converting to cooked tree

trbuild -> build a raw tree, write "msvgt2a.svg", duplicate the tree and
           write "msvgt2b.svg"

tcbuild -> build a cooked tree, convert to raw tree, print and write "msvgt3.svg"

tfont file.svg [font.svg] -> load the internal svg fonts in "file.svg", load the 
                             three standard fonts in "../gfonts", change text elements
                             in file.svg to a group of path elements using the matching
                             bfont in the lib loaded svg and write "msvgt5.svg"
                             if "font.svg" is provided load the fonts there and use the
                               first one as the matching bfont

tpa2poly file.svg -> read the svg file, find <path> elements and change them by
                     groups of <polygon> or <polyline> elements and finally write
                     "msvgt6.svg"

tbpsrv [-ng] file.svg -> read the svg file, convert to cooked, find gradients and
                         generate binary paint servers
                         if "-ng" is provided MsvgNormalizeRawGradients
                           is called before converting to cooked tree
